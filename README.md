# cat-vs-dog-cnn

**cat-vs-dog classification using cnn**

Dogs vs. Cats dataset provided by Microsoft Research contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats with the labels

1 = dog
0 = cat
For this project, i used a pre-trained model MobileNetV2 from keras.

**how to Build this project**
* 1. Load and preprocess images:
